# SpeakBot - Mapping high-level user input instruction to low-level robot commands üê¢
The main purpose for this project is to drive an OpenManipulatorX on a WafflePi mobile base, using Whisper API to gauge low-level interfacing commands from high-level verbal user instruction. Derived on Ubuntu 20.04, the pipeline aims to allow for intuitive command of a non-holonomic mobile base, utilising packages such as MoveIt for manipulator trajectory planning and gmapping for SLAM procedure.

The project is still ongoing seeing as its basis is academic. However, commits appended to the main branch will reflect modifications after formal academic submission.

Underlying prerequisites are provided by https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_manipulation.git
